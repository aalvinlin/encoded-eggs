# Encoded Eggs

Encode text in a variety of ways. The encoded text is then displayed line-by-line in an easy-to-read format.

# Description

This project provides puzzle enthusiasts a way to practice reading encoded text. While many tools exist to automatically decode text, such tools do not improve a user's fluency in reading the original encrypted text.

This project may also be helpful for a sighted person who is learning to read Braille (to produce or proofread Braille documents), or a person learning semaphore signalling (for disaster preparedness or for work).

# Provided Encodings

The encodings below are available in the project.

* ROT 13
* Semaphore
* Braille
* Numeric Indices

# Usage

## Quick Start

1. Type or paste the text to encode into the text box.
2. Click on the encoding to use.
3. Use the up and down arrows to move to the previous or next line of text.

## Advanced Usage

Use a blank line to denote a new page.

The following text will display as 2 pages.

```
one two three
four five six

seven eight nine
```

Page 1 (2 lines):
```
one two three
four five six
```

Page 2 (1 line):
```
seven eight nine
```

Currently, text is displayed with one line per screen, regardless of whether pages are specified.

However, a progress bar at the top of the screen will update based on the total number of pages remaining.

## Tips

Use a children's story with simple, repeated words to reduce the number of new symbols to learn.

*Green Eggs and Ham* is a great example.
